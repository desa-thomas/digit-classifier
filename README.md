## About

**Digit Classifier** is a machine learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a subset of the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits with 98% accuracy. I began this project to deepen my understanding of the PyTorch library and neural network architectures. Throughout the development process, I ended up learning a lot about data preparation, data cleaning, and full-stack development, and I am very happy with how the application and the model turned out. 

If you want to check out the application and try the model you can go to the [GitHub pages](https://desa-thomas.github.io/digit-classifier/) where the site is hosteds. If you want to see the different neural networks that I made before the Convolutional one you can fork the repository and go to the `model` directory, which contains all the PyTorch code I used to build and train the model. Thank you for checking out my project. If you liked it, be sure to give it a star ⭐, I’d really appreciate it!

## Roadmap
- [x] Detect bounding boxes of images to better prepare the image data and increase model performance on user input
- [ ] Anomaly detection for non-digit images
